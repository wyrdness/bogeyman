      "summary": "Universal childhood fear figure used to frighten children into good behavior, appearing as a shapeless monster that punishes naughty children and lurks in dark places.",
      "full": "The Bogeyman is a universal figure found in nearly every culture worldwide, representing a shapeless monster or malevolent being used to frighten children into obedience and good behavior. Unlike most folklore creatures with specific characteristics, the Bogeyman is deliberately vague and formless - described variably as a monster under the bed, a creature in the closet, a man with a sack who abducts misbehaving children, or simply as lurking darkness itself. This lack of fixed form allows children's imaginations to fill in the terrifying details, making the Bogeyman uniquely personal to each child. The figure serves as a cautionary tool used by parents and caregivers to enforce bedtime, discourage dangerous behavior, and promote obedience. The Bogeyman exists in countless cultural variations (El Coco, Babau, Butzemann, etc.) but always serves the same fundamental purpose: personifying childhood fears and consequences of misbehavior. In modern times, the practice is considered questionable parenting by some, yet the Bogeyman persists in global folklore and popular culture, evolving with each generation."
